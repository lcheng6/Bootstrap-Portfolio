# Week 2 Assignment

### Overview
In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be an update of the one you made last week&mdash;you'll enhance this one with a mobile-responsive layout. For your second portfolio, youâ€™ll build a layout with the Bootstrap CSS framework.


### Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.
### Assignment Two Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Use Bootstrap CSS to recreate the portfolio you built last week. Your Bootstrap solution should *not* make explicit use of media queries.

3. Create the `index.php` and `composer.json` inside `Bootstrap-Portfolio`
  * Make sure you have `<?php include_once("yourFileNameHere"); ?>` and `{}` for those files.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to Heroku. Remember:
  * `heroku login`
  * `heroku create`
  * `git push heroku master`

5. Alternatively, deploy your new portfolio using the `gh_pages` branch of your repository.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootcampSpot.com](http://bootcampspot.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. If you deployed to Heroku, submit the link to your Heroku site in the same input field.
